# LRRH, another tiny & fast & functional WebKitGTK browser

![Main window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aarnt/lrrh/master/lrrh-mainwindow.png)

LRRH is a [BadWolf](https://hacktivis.me/projects/badwolf) derived browser with *sane keybindings*, dark mode, kiosk mode, middle mouse click to open hyperlinks on new tabs and Gemini/Gopher protocol support (trough external aplications).


It stands for "Little Red Riding Hood", an European fairy tale about a young girl and a Big Bad Wolf.


These are the keybinds used in LRRH:

## Differencies
Comparing from other small WebKit browsers for unixes found in the wild:

- Independent of environment, should just work if GTK and WebKitGTK does
- Storing data should be:
  - explicit and optionnal (ie. Applying preferences doesn't imply Saving to disk)
  - not queryabe by WebKit (so the web can't use it)
  - done in a standard format (like XBEL for bookmarks)
- Static UI, no element should be added at runtime, this is to avoid potential tracking via viewport changes
- Small codebase, should be possible to read and understand it completely over an afternoon.
- Does not use modal editing (from vi) as that was designed for editing, not browsing
- UTF-8 encoding by default

## Manual Installation
Dependencies are:

- POSIX-compatible Shell (ie. mrsh, dash, lksh)
- C11 Compiler (such as clang or gcc)
- [WebKitGTK](https://webkitgtk.org/), only the latest stable(2.32.0+) is supported
- [libxml-2.0](http://www.xmlsoft.org/), no known version limitation
- POSIX make with extension for shell in variables (works with GNU, {Net,Free,Open}BSD)
- A pkg-config implementation (pkgconf is recommended)
- (optional) gettext implementation (such as GNU Gettext)
- (optional, test) [mandoc](https://mdocml.bsd.lv/) (the command) for linting the manpage

Compilation is done with `./configure && make`, install with `make install` (`DESTDIR` and `PREFIX` environment variables are supported, amongs other common ones). An example AppArmor profile is provided at `usr.bin.badwolf`, please do some long runtime checks before shipping it or a modified version, help can be provided but with no support.

You'll also need inkscape (command line only) if you want to regenerate the icons, for example after modifying them or adding a new size. These aren't needed for normal installation as it is bundled.

## Notes
Most of the privacy/security stuff will be done with patches against WebKit as quite a lot isnâ€™t into [WebKitSettings](https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/WebKitSettings.html) and with generic WebKit extensions that should be resuseable.
